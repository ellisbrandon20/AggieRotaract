# AggieRotaract 431 Project

This is a Organization Management System web application for Texas A&M Universities student organization Aggie Rotaract. Aggie Rotaract is a Rotaract organization where students are able to sign up for various volunteer events in the Bryan/College Station area. This application started as a class project for CSCE 431: Software Engineering where a team of 6 students worked on this as a team utilizing pair programming to implement user stories. Jared Russell was the Scrum Master and led weekly scrum meetings. Brandon Ellis was the Product Owner where he was the direct communicator between the development team and the client. He also held interviews with the organization to gather requirements and feature precedence. The team met with the organization bi-weekly to show off implemented user stories to receive feedback and make notes on any changes that would need to be made with the newly implemented features. This project was utilizing the Test Driven Development process where we designed and came up with test cases before implementing any code to make sure we had a well thought out design of a feature.

This project is going to replace the current system that Aggie Rotaract uses which was a series of Google Sheets connected via code that ended up not being as reliable as they had hoped. 

###This project is an on-going project and continuing to add feautres and communicating with the organization will be Brandon Ellis
