DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]
